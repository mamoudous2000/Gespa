I have used Umbrello as UML modeller in this project.
It is usually installed by default with KDE.

You can find out more about it at:
http://uml.sourceforge.net/index.php

I have exported all diagrams in .png files so you don't have
to install Umbrello to see them.

The .xmi file is the Umbrello format.

The purpose of these diagrams is to make project more clear to
understand.


NOTE: You will not see anything more if using umbrello to open the .xmi
file . I have exported all diagrammes to .png files
