PHP Security Scanner grew out of my need for better code security. I feel
that it is a very good idea to have some kind of a tool that could be used
on regular basis...to check on what might be wrong with your code. Well, this
sounds like an ultimate tool but it appears this is not an easy thing to do.

The task of doing such a tool is very demanding for one main reason - security
is a process not a state. So, in order this tool to be of any use it should be
constantly updated with latest security problems out there...not easy to follow
by yourself, believe me. Actually, that is one of the reasons I decided to share my
thoughts open source. I believe that the more people out there are interested in the
idea the better chances this becomes useful tool.

PHP Security Scanner is initially designed to have two separate "modules".
One is the executable php shell script that is supposed to scan through php source
code for predefined patterns. And the other is a web interface used to display the
results from the search. The idea of an executable php shell script is to have the
script executed anywhere you want. Of course you'll need CLI PHP since its a php
script...but on the other hand it is somehow more secure not exposing it to the web.

I've tried to do this tool as secure as possible...but I am by no means a
php guru...so, if you're going to use this try to use it in a semi-private
area until this package has been looked through a few times.

I'd appreciate an email letting me know if you find this program useful.
I won't publish any information without permission. I'd just like a feedback
and knowing I'm helping people will only motivate me more.

Also, let me know if you see any ways I can improve my code or design.
Insights into better ways to implement functionality and features will
only help out everyone using the package.
