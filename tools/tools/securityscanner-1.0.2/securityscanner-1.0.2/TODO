SOON:
    0. Improve DB design so that no need of serializing data.
    1. Strip all comments from file before scanning. Should improve performance and results.
    2. Write a secure way to link interface results page to the corresponding file. Seeing the
        source of the file via a link. Now it just gives the file path for the user
        to check manually.

LATER:

    0. Parse the files with possible vulnarabilities so we can highlight problematic
        variables, sections etc. Search for undefined variables etc.
    1. Remove the need of modifying the config.php every time we need different
        filter on files/directories to scan.
    2. Package php shell script, class file and config file in one. Possibly using .phar files.

Conceptual:

    Have to think of a way to use the php parser(token functions) for the whole scanning. This will
    increase performance and accuracy significantly.
