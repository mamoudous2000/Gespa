                        Spike phpSecAudit Release Notes
                        ===============================

SVN Revision Changes - So Far - askumar
------------

 Change Log: 
 
 1. PHPCheckstyle's HTML Outputting methods have been appended, and 
    command line output has been removed, leaving either text file or 
    html file output.

 2. Output Directory and Format options provided to command line execution.

 3. All directory references have been made relative to PHPSECAUDIT_HOME_DIR,
    so that other locations may execute classes.
  
 4. The Reporter class carries all the log... functions. The TextReporter
    and XmlReporter classes simply extend Reporter and decide how to 
    output the information.

 Known Issues:

 1. Some text output functionality lost in html, such as severity and context.
    This should be easily resolvable, as the Reporting classes have been 
    better organized.

Version 0.23
------------

 This is the second release of Spike phpSecAudit.

 Change Log:

 1. Modified  to be PHP 4 friendly.

 2. Added a few functions to the knowledge-base: extract, shell_exec, pcntl_exec, exec. 

 3. Slightly improved the organization of the knowledge-base file (vuln_db.xml).


 Known issues:

 1. [Unverified], _getAllPhpFiles function may miss a few.

 2. Tokenizer needs to be able to differentiate between a native function
    call and class method call of the same name, i.e. mail() and $class->mail().



Version 0.19
------------

 This is the very first release of Spike phpSecAudit. It is an alpha release.

 Known issues:
 
 1. The knowledge-base needs to be refreshed.
 
 2. The project needs a better reporting.
 
 

 We are indebted to several projects and people whose contributions have
 tremendously helped this effort. They are
 
 1. RATS project.
    http://www.securesoftware.com/resources/download_rats.html
    They preceded us in creating a PHP static analysis tool and, hence,
    tremendously helped educate us in this subject. We follow their
    vulnerability db semantics. Currently we use their PHP vulnerability
    database, although we plan to aggressively improve upon it.
    
 2. Hari Kodungallur and the Spike PHPCheckstyle project.
    http://developer.spikesource.com/projects/phpcheckstyle
    His TokenUtils.php is adopted to this project. Without his utility, this
    project would have taken much much longer to write.
